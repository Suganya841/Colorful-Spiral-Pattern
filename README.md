# Colorful-Spiral-Pattern
This program uses the Turtle Graphics library along with the colorsys module to draw a vibrant spiral art pattern.  The turtle is positioned and set to maximum drawing speed.  The background is set to black for better color contrast.  The program uses HSV to RGB conversion, so the colors keep changing smoothly, creating a rainbow effect.
